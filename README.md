Okay I am making this file so we can say the exact way we are going to do things.

### Steps that you should follow when you want to make a new feature.

1. go to [trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/vvXSvqyg/3532a39dd990c521f257b2c77bc6c690/games-capstone) and then make a task for what you are going to do. then drag that task into implementing. Just so we know what you are doing.

2. make a seperate branch with the feature name in the github repo (eg movement). to create a new branch you can type 
``` git checkout -b *branchname* ```
to switch branches you can type
``` got checkout *branchname* ```

3. Make your change.

4. commit your change

4. push your code to the branch on the remote repo
``` git push origin *branchname* ```

5. go to github and create a pull request

6. move trello card to pull request

7. if someone has comments then you can discuss possible issues and maybe fix them then redo from 4 except the pull request will automatically be updated when you push.

8. if no comments then merge (or your reviewer can merge)

9. move trello card to done.

10. repeat
